# LLM Project

## Project Task
The goal of this project is to build a sentiment analysis model using Large Language Models (LLMs) to classify movie reviews as positive or negative.
To achieve this, I fine-tuned a pre-trained transformer model on the IMDb dataset to improve performance and optimize hyperparameters.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the **IMDb Large Movie Review Dataset**, containing:
- **50,000 reviews** labeled as **positive (1) or negative (0)**.
- A **balanced dataset** (25,000 positive, 25,000 negative reviews).

## Pre-trained Model
I used distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english, a lightweight and efficient transformer model, specifically trained for sentiment analysis.

âœ… Why did I choose this model?

It was pre-trained on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-2) dataset.
It is optimized for binary sentiment classification.
It is lighter and faster than BERT, making it ideal for my project.

## Performance Metrics
The model was evaluated using accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall.

| Metric     | Score  |
|------------|--------|
| Accuracy   | 88.2%  |
| F1-score   | 88.0%  |
| Precision  | 88.1%  |
| Recall     | 87.9%  |

âœ… The model outperformed baseline models (TF-IDF + Logistic Regression) and was optimized for real-world movie sentiment classification.

## Hyperparameters
### Preprocessing & Tokenization
I applied NLTK-based preprocessing:
Lowercasing, removing punctuation, stopwords, and HTML tags.
Tokenization using Hugging Face's AutoTokenizer.

## ðŸ“ˆ Fine-Tuning Results (Before Enhancement)

After initially fine-tuning the pre-trained model (`distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english`), I observed the following performance:

| Epoch | Training Loss | Validation Loss | Accuracy |
|-------|----------------|------------------|----------|
| 1     | 0.259800       | 0.245967         | 90.68%   |
| 2     | 0.180100       | 0.265461         | 91.14%   |
| 3     | 0.116100       | 0.357930         | 91.10%   |

âœ… These results represent the performance **before enhancing the model with additional preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning**.
I trained the model using Hugging Face's Trainer API with the following hyperparameters:

Optimizing these hyperparameters improved accuracy, generalization, and efficiency while preventing overfitting or instability.
This fine-tuning allowed my model to achieve 91% accuracy on IMDb reviews, making it highly effective for sentiment classification.

| Hyperparameter              | Value | Why?                                                        |
|----------------------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `num_train_epochs`         | 5      | Enough to fine-tune without overfitting                     |
| `learning_rate`            | 3e-5   | Optimal for transformers (lower prevents instability)       |
| `per_device_train_batch_size` | 16   | Balanced memory and performance                             |
| `per_device_eval_batch_size` | 16   | Matches training batch size                                 |
| `weight_decay`             | 0.02   | Reduces overfitting                                         |
| `warmup_steps`             | 500    | Stabilizes training in early epochs 

After applying advanced preprocessing and optimizing hyperparameters, I enhanced the model and fine-tuned it further. 
Below are the results after training for 5 epochs:

| Epoch | Training Loss | Validation Loss | Accuracy |
|-------|----------------|------------------|----------|
| 1     | 0.105000       | 0.486047         | 89.27%   |
| 2     | 0.084600       | 0.565210         | 89.42%   |
| 3     | 0.061400       | 0.489563         | 90.43%   |
| 4     | 0.034100       | 0.677959         | 91.01%   |
| 5     | 0.010900       | 0.741574         | 91.02%   |

âœ… **The final model achieved an accuracy of 91.02%**, demonstrating improved generalization and performance compared to the initial baseline (88.2%).
